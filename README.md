Text-Based-RPG
==============
I created this project as part of my Intro to Computer Science class. The game parts of it are not perfect, but the coding works. In hindsight I should have done it very differently, so maybe one day I'll go back and fix it up.

Instead of altering JPanels I created a new JFrame every time I wanted to change it. It would have been better to have broken it down, especially into more classes and files than what I have.
